    <h1>Best New Sedans of 2022</h1>

            <h2>Hyundai Accent</h2>
            <p>The Kia Rio represents cheap, simple transportation at its best. 
                Fuel efficient and inexpensive but with a surprising amount of driving 
                sophistication and features for the price, 
                this subcompact provides good value for the money.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <img src="images/honda accent.jfif" alt="honda accent"/>
            <h2>Honda Civic Si</h2>
            <p>The 2022 Honda Civic Si is arguably the sweet spot in the brand's small-car line, 
                with a near-perfect ratio of performance and daily-driver traits. 
                We even named it to our Editors' Choice list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
            <img src="images/hyundai.jfif" alt="hyundai"/>
            <h2>Hyundai Elantra N</h2>
            <p>Hyundai is expanding its N performance sub-brand with 
                fire-breathing version of its new Elantra compact car. The 2022 Elantra N is 
                powered by a 286-hp version of 
                the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder from the spunky Veloster N hatchback.</p>

            <img src="images/mazda.jfif" alt="mazda"/>
            <h2>Mazda 3</h2>
            <p>For buyers with champagne taste but only a sparkling-cider budget, 
                the 2022 Mazda 3 delivers a premium package at a normal compact-car price. 
                It's offered both as a sedan and a hatchback 
                and can be equipped with optional all-wheel drive, a punchy turbo engine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="five">
            <img src="images/volks.jpg" alt="volkswagen"/>
            <h2>Volkswagen Jetta GLI</h2>
            <p>The 2022 Volkswagen Jetta GLI is about as satisfying as moderately priced sports 
                sedans get. Volkswagen's recipe is simple and well-executed. Spawned from the 
                regular Jetta (reviewed separately), 
                the high-performance variant enjoys the same spacious interior</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six">
            <img src="images/honda.jpg" alt="honda accord"/>
            <h2>Honda Accord</h2>
            <p>Although SUVs and crossovers are the people haulers these days, we think those 
                folks are missing out by not considering the superb 2022 
                Honda Accord sedan. The Accord can do most things your average compact crossover can do.</p>
